# First Repo

This is a test organization repo for my N215 class

## Purpose

This final project will:

-Be a single-page application

-Must be in an MVC format

-Look just like the travel-fly home work assignment and this prototype:

-Must include all the pages.

-Must use jQuery or pure JavaScript

-Must navigate using the URL

## Task

For this homework assignment, you will:

-You must create a project named final-project

-You must take your old travel-fly project and turn it into a single-page application.

-It must look exactly like the travel-fly prototype

-You can find the fonts and images under the Files > Travel-fly folder

-You must use jQuery or JavaScript

-Use only one page and load all the content onto that page dynamically.

-You must navigate using the routing that I showed you in class. This uses the URL for navigation.

-Must use the MVC model we have discussed, and it must by type module

-Upload your project to Github and Web4 and add your Web4 link to the README file in Github, and submit your Github link.
